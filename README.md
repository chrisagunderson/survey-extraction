# survey-extraction

This [python script](https://github.com/chrisagunderson/survey-extraction/blob/master/extract-csv-from-zip-files.py) extracts `.csv` files from multiple `.zip` files and the compiles all of the `.csv` files into one main `.csv` files.

Data is sometimes stored in `.zip` files but contains more information or files than what is needed for a project. The goal here was to compile each of the survey responses from different participants so their responses could be analyzed in aggregate.

For instructions on running the script, see https://chrisagunderson.github.io/survey-extraction/
