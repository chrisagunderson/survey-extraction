# survey-extraction

This [python script](https://github.com/chrisagunderson/survey-extraction/blob/master/extract-csv-from-zip-files.py) extracts `.csv` files from multiple `.zip` files and the compiles all of the `.csv` files into one primary `.csv` file.

Data is sometimes stored in `.zip` files but contains more information or files (e.g., `.txt`) than what is needed for a project. Since each of the `.csv` files contain the same variable names, these could be compiled into one primary file to analyze the participant responses in aggregate.

For instructions on running the script, see https://chrisagunderson.github.io/survey-extraction/
